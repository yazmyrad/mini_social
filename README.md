Hi there!
1. Install all dependencies, of course postgresql
2. Create file, which you will use as virtual environment
3. Create DB in that environment and try running config_db.py and connect.py
4. If all works, run schema.py to create all tables for storing data in DB
5. Then you can run main.py and visit localhost to see how it works.
